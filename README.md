## Unnamed RTS game
This is a hobby project that is a continuation of my 3D graphical programming experiments. This project is more focused and less open ended and also draws from what I've learned building [wgpu-render-node](https://github.com/Nehliin/wgpu-render-node/blob/master/Cargo.toml) and [smol-engine](https://github.com/Nehliin/smol-engine). It's currently not even close to a game.


Current goals:
- [x] Multi-threaded rendering
- [x] Ui support using egui
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] RTS game mechanics
- [ ] Map editor
- [ ] Basic Online multiplayer support

### Screenshot
Not much to look at currently but feels like all graphical repos should have at least a one screenshot
